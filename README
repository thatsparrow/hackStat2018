### DATA

Variables: 2
Type: Structured 

### TO-DO

(1) Historical: 

Solve the forecasting problem as a time series modeling problem

(2) Advanced:

Use reserveration data or increment of bookings N from now to a day T (for which there are already K reservations) in the future

### TOOLS

Ridege Regression
Kernel Ride Regression
Multilayer Perceptron
Radial Basis Function Networks

### VISUALIZATION

Matplotlib 
PostreSQL 
SQLite 
Mathematica
Matlab
Power BI

### CONCLUSION 

"Results show a Ridge regression model with quadratic features trained on the reservations data set, outperforms the other models considered, with a validation set MAPE of 8.2012% and a test set MAPE of 8.6561%... Finally, the use of bookings and reservations known in advance offered the best performance. The results obtained are promising and support the use of black-box Machine Learning based tools for estimating hotel occupation, which require little statistical expertise by the hotel staff; allowing for a more effective deployment of Revenue Management techniques in the hospitality sector." - William Caicedo-Torres and Fabi√°n Payares (November 2016)
